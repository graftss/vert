- test gamepad button/axis listener
- need a way of extracting the atomic display `Params` data from entities
    - put this in `AtomicInputDisplay`
    - is this actually necessary?


- editor mode:
    - clickable atomic displays
    - list of all atomic displays
    - ui widget for each component type
    - ideally, drag-resizable frame
    - stop drag/scroll events when hovering over inspector ui
    - hotkey to hide/show the worldinspector
- change window title according to gamestate (editor/controllerconfig/present)
- statistics?
    - total presses for each button
    - analog stick distance moved??
