- test gamepad button/axis listener
- need a way of extracting the atomic display `Params` data from entities
    - put this in `AtomicInputDisplay`
    - is this actually necessary?


- editor mode:
    - hotkey to hide/show the worldinspector
- statistics?
    - total presses for each button
    - analog stick distance moved??
- reset `InputListener` when appstate changes
- layout.json isn't updating anymore

- impl inspectable for remaining params fields
- create new atom
    - spawn in center of screen
- delete atom
    - add button in inspector ui
- filter out all non-params components from inspector
- fs stuff
    - list of all displays in a folder
    - drag display file into editor to load into
    - load display file from url??
