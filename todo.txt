- test gamepad button/axis listener
- need a way of extracting the atomic display `Params` data from entities
    - put this in `AtomicInputDisplay`
    - is this actually necessary?


- editor mode:
    - actually make editor mode (extract input display rendering components)
    - just make `AppState` a stack of height 2, where:
        - input display state is on the bottom
        - the top state is ConfigController/Editor/present
        - this way the input display is always rendered, which is probably desirable
    - move by dragging mouse
    - zoom in/out with scroll wheel
    - clickable atomic displays
    - list of all atomic displays
