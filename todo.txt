- test gamepad button/axis listener
- need a way of extracting the atomic display `Params` data from entities
    - put this in `AtomicInputDisplay`
    - is this actually necessary?


- editor mode:
    - hotkey to hide/show the worldinspector
- statistics?
    - total presses for each button
    - analog stick distance moved??

- create new atom
    - spawn in center of screen
- fs stuff
    - drag display file into editor to load into
    - load display file from url??
- analog trigger color

hotkeys:
    - F2 = editor
    - F3 = configure controller
    - F4 = present
